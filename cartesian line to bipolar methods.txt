WAYS TO CONVERT A CONTINUOUS CARTESIAN LINE (x0,y0), (x1, y1) INTO A SERIES OF DISCRETE BIPOLAR COORDINATES

-Split the cartesian line into N sample points. Eg to split it into N lines:
  for(i=0; i<=N; i++) {
    x = (x1-x0)*i/N + x0
    y = (y1-y0)*i/N + y0
    // convert (x,y) to bipolar coordinates
    // do stuff
  }

-Split the sample points at a resolution high enough that all posible points on the line are included ("oversampling", I guess). Then handle duplicate points somehow. The bad thing is that this can make the lines more jagged.

-Calculate all the discrete bipolar coordinates within a certain distance from the line.
